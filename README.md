"""
This project contains a jupyter notebook file with extension .ipynb. The iPython file reads the data of four prominent tech stocks namely _Apple,Google,Microsoft and Amazon_ from yahoofinance dataservers into four dataframes and then performs analysis related to single stock[AAPL] and correlation between all stocks and much more. It also calculates 5% VaR of AAPL stock using parametric method and also simulates the price of AAPL stock over next year with the help of MONTE CARLO with 100 and 10,000 runs. Finally we calculate 1% VaR from price calculated through Monte Carlo simulations. The libraries used are numpy,pandas,seaborn,yfinance,datetime and matplotlib.
